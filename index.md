title: Welcome to my blog
I am Tuck Wai, mechatronics engineering graduate that previously worked a year as Graduate Trainee in Intel Microelectronics as **Pre-Silicon Validation Engineer** but unfortunately not able to convert to permanent position due to internal hiring freeze happened at that time.Now I am learning about web development and trying to venture to another field to seek for better career pathway with higher compensation, in the midst of possible sustained economy slowdown causes the local currency is dropping, inflation and life is never been harder than now .
